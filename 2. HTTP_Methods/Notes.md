## HTTP Methods

- Software is divided into 2 types: **Static** and **Dynamic**.

# Static Software:
- These are a kind of software that has very low **User Interaction** and are only used to work upon a specific use-case. For example a **Calendar App**, this app is only used to check upon the date and some minor things like holidays, etc. It doesn't give any kind of request to any other server nor does it take any kind of input and the use cases are also very much constrained.

# Dynamic Software:
- It's the vice-versa of **Static Software**. Built to work upon multiple features and contains multiple things that can enrich the user experience. For Example- **MS Word**, you can edit stuff, create tables, add pictures, add hyperlinks, convert word to pdf and so many things. It does have some minor request handling like uploading the file to **Drive** or checking the account validation and some other stuff.
- You can interact with a **Dynamic Software** in 4 types only. This is given a name called **C.R.U.D** i.e **Create**, **Retrieve**, **Update** and **Delete**.

- In the same way, websites are also divided into 2 types i.e. **Dynamic** and **Static**.
- You can call them as a kind of software only but the difference is that it is hosted in some other place which we call **server** and we as a **client** access it through a protocol called **HTTPS**. This is a 2-way protocol that handles requests of **put**, **post**, **delete** and **get** methods.
- Examples of **Static websites** are blog pages, documentation pages where there isn't much of a use case other than accessing it and reading it or more commonly redirecting to other webpages.
- Examples of **Dynamic Website** are common shopping platforms where you create a buy order, update your address, retrieve invoices for your products or even delete your account.
