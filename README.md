## Why I am doing this?

Apart from getting knowledge about AI and with this competition we are proceeding ahead off, the question here arises is whether we will be able to get more junior poisitions or no, so to ease up the gaps I am here learning about FastAPI to step up in creating user friendly apps or Agents.

## What does the repository contains? And what are these folders?

These folders carry every video's code and notes which I have written as per my understanding.
Will be completing this whole series within some days and will often update with some data or anything whenever I come across some new things or some updates.

## Contributing

## Acknowledgements
This whole repository is for storing my knowledge as well as my learnings on FastAPI. I have learnt all these things from the great Indian Educational Youtuber [Nitish Singh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJKsPchji0Q&list=PLKnIA16_RmvZ41tjbKB2ZnwchfniNsMuQ).
I am following his LangChain Tutorial as well.
